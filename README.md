# Dual-Class Arbitrage Identifier

Dual-class arbitrage emerges when dual-listed stocks (different stock classes of the same security) trade at different prices. A profit can be made by going long on the stock class that trades for less and going short on the other stock in the pair. Some examples of dual-listed stocks are Alphabet Inc. ('GOOG', 'GOOGL') and Liberty Broadband Corporation ('LBRDK', 'LBRDA').

This project gathers information on dual-listed stocks in the S&P 500 index and plots the arbitrage-spread (the difference in the trading prices of the dual-listed pair stocks) for every minute. These plots can be used a reference to pair-trade these stocks and make a profit while the spread is not close to 0 (in either direction).
